## Array Reversal

### Description
Create a function named ArrayReversal that accepts an array as its parameter.
Without using any built-in methods, return a new array where the elements are in reverse order.

### Approach
1. Create a new array to store the reversed elements
2. Iterate through the input array from the last element to the first
3. Add each element to the new array
4. Return the new array

### Example
```javascript
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```
